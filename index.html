        <p>
          Meet Swara, a nineteen year old teenager who has lost her best
          friend, and secret crush. Unable to deal with her pain flees her
          city to start life afresh in a new one.
        </p><br>

        <p>
          Still, haunted by the memories of her lost mate, she manages to meet
          new people, new friends and things seem to all be going fine until
          she decides to return home for some quality time with her family.
          Sounds pretty harmless and fun right? WRONG!
        </p><br>

        <p>
          When Swara arrives home she is contacted by her best friend's mum,
          Mrs. Bose who wants to hand her something. A book. A token which she
          can hold dear and preserve Karthik's memory. Sounds like a sweet
          gesture, till Swara pays her a visit and discovers her real plans.
        </p><br>

        <p>
          Mrs. Bose plans to resurrect her son and all she needs is a partner
          who believes in the cause. Someone who also had a close tie to
          Karthik and guess who the lucky nominee is?
        </p><br>

        <p>
          The ritual is simple ... spill some blood...chant some words...
          nothing major right... How far would you go to bring your best
          friend back from the dead? Are the lines between reality and fantasy
          metres apart or closely blurred? How far can someone go to hold you
          to promise? Swara is about to find out... and so will you.

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <button class="collapsible">1. How long ago did you start writing?</button>
      <div class="content">
        Writing has always been a passion for me. I remember back to as early as a fourteen year old teenager, reading
        books and wondering. What if they ended differently?
        What if I controlled the endings? What if?
        Needless to say I started a few books back then but wrote for a completely different audience (kids) but I only
        managed to complete one manuscript which was lost between crashing PCs alongside with other uncompleted
        manuscripts. <br><br>
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">2. How did you get into writing?</button>
      <div class="content">
        It started when I took Drama class in highschool . That point towards the end of grade 9 when you are sitting
        there confused about where you want to go in life because it does not fit into what the world or others may
        expect of you.

        Drama was my way of escaping from what people believed the real world was like. Why? Because in drama you could
        be anyone you wanted to be. You could be courageous , bold, even if your personality was a shy and quiet little
        kid.
        Going fourth I soon discovered my acting was okayish but a lot of my classmates and teachers had extreme praise
        for one thing .... My writing!
        So , I wrote and wrote scripts , something that really didn't feel like hard work for me, WHY? Because it wasn't
        a job. It was me expressing and creating art.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">3. So, did you stop writing?</button>
      <div class="content">
        Yes, after highschool, after drama was over. I tried my hand at a book aimed at teenagers but stopped it
        somewhere down the path and forgot about it.
        When I wrote back then, those were stories that I planned to just show friends or family... maybe even keep them
        for myself. I didn't plan on publishing them.
        I wrote because I felt the desire to.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">4. How did you get back?</button>
      <div class="content">
        Years later I found myself in a job that I didn't have much passion for and found myself wanting more.
        Writing came to my mind and I thought why not pursue it? Why not make it a career... So , I quitted my job and
        went on to follow my dream .
        I never looked back nor do I have any regrets.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">5. Is Sinister Spells a stand alone book or part of a series?</button>
      <div class="content">
        Years Both! It is a stand alone story but yes it is part of a series. The books , depending on the nature, will
        fall into the category of Lilmohorror or Lilmothriller.
        No they are not separate series. I found that if a book is horror , I should term it as such and the same goes
        for thriller.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">6. Will the book be available in hardcover and audiobook?</button>
      <div class="content">
        For now the book will be available in Paperback and as an ebook.
        However, this doesn't mean that I will not consider doing a hardcover version and an audiobook version.
        It is all dependent on what my readers want.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">7. Will there be a part 2 to Sinister Spells?</button>
      <div class="content">
        Why not? The book definitely has room for a part two , all my books do.
        If there is a demand you will definitely see a part 2.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">8. How many books have you completed?</button>
      <div class="content">
        I have completed seven. Six however need to be edited. Editing does take time though.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">9. Are you working on any projects currently?</button>
      <div class="content">
        Yes, I am working on book eight, nine and ten. I move between them depending on the ideas I get.
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">10. Do you plan to ever stop writing?</button>
      <div class="content">
        No way!
      </div>

    <section id="futureprojects">
      <h1>Futurte Projects</h1>
      <p>I am currently working on book eight , nine and ten simultaneously. I am at the beginning stages for all three
        books. I hopped between the three books as I am inspired by ideas relevant to those individual titles.
        I tend to write an idea when it immediately comes to mind so I can draft the best chapter while it's still fresh
        in my head. I am currently editing my second book which will fall under the Lilmothriller banner. I am planning
        to
        release it towards the end of 2020 or early next year.
        In terms of content the second book has been completed. I plan to release a minimum of two books , with a
        maximum
        of four books yearly. For more information keep checking the website as I will be updating it regularly.</p>
